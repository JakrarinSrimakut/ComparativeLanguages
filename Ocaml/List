Lists must be uniform in their type ("homogeneous")
Lists are immutable ( we can't change them)
List operations are numerous:


let x = ['a';'b'];;



let y = 'c'::x;; (* add an element on to a list *)



let z=x@y;; (* appending lists *)



List.hd x;; (* head: first element of a list *)



List.tl x;; (*the tail or rest of a list*)
